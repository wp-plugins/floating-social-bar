Floating Social Bar is the best social media plugin for WordPress that adds a floating bar with share buttons to your content without slowing down your site.

== Description ==

Social media share buttons are a must have for every site, but they can significantly impact your site's speed. At [WPBeginner](http://www.wpbeginner.com "WPBeginner"), we created the floating social bar to maximize our social media visibility without impacting our site speed.

Floating social bar is a light-weight WordPress plugin that adds a floating bar with share buttons to your blog posts, pages, and other post types. The floating ability allows this eye-catching bar to get you maximum shares.

= Slim and Fast =

Unlike other social media plugins, we only support major social media networks to keep our plugin slim. You can add share buttons for Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.

Floating Social Bar only loads scripts when necessary. None of the social media scripts are loaded when the page is loaded. Instead we show a replica image with all the counts. We use the socialite script to only load social buttons when the user brings their mouse over the button. Doing this allows us to keep your site load just as fast as it was loading without any social plugins.

= Easy to Use =

Floating Social Bar is extremely easy to use. There is a simple options interface that allows you to drag-and-drop the social buttons that you want to show. You can also use the drag-drop interface to control the order of how social share buttons appear on your site.

= Best Social Media Plugin =

"What is the best social media plugin?" is one of the most common questions that we get asked at [WPBeginner](http://www.wpbeginner.com "WPBeginner"). We found it hard to recommend social plugins for WordPress because none of them met our standards. We only recommend what we use or would use. After numerous requests from our users, we decided to release our internal social plugin for our audience and the greater WordPress community.

This plugin is being used on WPBeginner, [List25](http://list25.com "List25"), [SteadyStrength](http://www.steadystrength.com "SteadyStrength"), and numerous other properties of ours.

= Support =

We will do our best to provide support through the WordPress forums. However, please understand that this is a free plugin, so support will be limited.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a template tag for the plugin? =

Yes, in fact there is both a template tag and a shortcode available for use.

**Template Tag:** `floating_social_bar( $args = array(), $return = false )`

In the template tag, you can pass in an array of arguments to denote which social services you want displayed. The order in which the services are entered will be the order in which they are displayed. The following keys are available for use:

* facebook
* twitter
* google
* linkedin
* pinterest

For example, if you want to use the template tag to add in facebook and twitter services, you would do the following:

`if ( function_exists( 'floating_social_bar' ) ) floating_social_bar( array( 'facebook' => true, 'twitter' => true ) );`

**Shortcode:** `[fsb-social-bar]`

The shortcode takes the same parameters as the template with the following syntax:

`[fsb-social-bar facebook="true" twitter="true"]`
